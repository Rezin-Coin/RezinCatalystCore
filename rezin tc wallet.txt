If you lose these your wallet cannot be recreated!

It looks like RezinCatalystd isn't open!

Ensure RezinCatalystd is open and has finished syncing. (It will often not respond when syncing)
If it's still not working, try restarting RezinCatalystd (or try a different remote node).
The daemon sometimes gets stuck.
Alternatively, perhaps RezinCatalystd can't communicate with any peers.

The wallet can't function fully until it can communicate with the network.
